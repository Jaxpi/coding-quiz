## Description

This application allows users to study javascript concepts and skills and compare their results to previous attempts and other users.

This was created to make studying javascript more interactive and enjoyable, and to get a sense of where the user stands in comparison to others or their previous attempts.

## Usage

The user clicks the start button to begin the quiz and is presented with the first question and 4 possible answers. The timer begins to count down from 60 seconds while the user determines which option to select. When the user selects an option the next question propagates and a message is displayed to let the user know if they got the previous answer correct or not. If the user is correct then a point is added to the correct answer tally, but if incorrect then time is removed from the countdown.

If time runs out or if all questions have been answered then the quiz is over and the user's total points are displayed along with an input box for them to enter their initials. If the user's score is one of the 3 highest in the local storage then their initials and score are added to the "high scores" hall of fame!
